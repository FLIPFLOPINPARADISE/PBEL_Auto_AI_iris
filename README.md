# 🌸 AutoAI Iris Flower Classification

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a machine learning model using **IBM Watson Studio's AutoAI** to classify Iris flower species based on physical attributes.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Use IBM Watson Studio's AutoAI to automate:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Deployment as a REST API

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- IBM Watson Studio
- AutoAI (Automated Machine Learning)
- Python
- CSV Dataset (Iris)
- REST API (for deployment)

---

## 📊 Dataset: Iris

The [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) is a classic dataset in machine learning with:
- **150 rows**
- **4 features**:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- **1 target**:
  - Species (`setosa`, `versicolor`, `virginica`)

---

## 🧪 Steps Followed

1. Created an IBM Cloud account and accessed Watson Studio.
2. Created a new project in Watson Studio.
3. Uploaded the `iris.csv` dataset.
4. Launched an AutoAI experiment.
5. Selected `species` as the target column.
6. Let AutoAI train, rank, and optimize multiple models.
7. Chose the best-performing pipeline.
8. Deployed the model as a REST API.
9. (Optional) Downloaded Python code for the full ML pipeline.

## ✅ Results

- AutoAI automatically handled preprocessing and model tuning.
- Achieved high classification accuracy on test data.
- Model is deployed and accessible via REST API.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

You can deploy the model directly from Watson Studio:
- Go to your project > Models
- Select the model > Deploy
- Choose **Online Deployment** to get a REST API endpoint
